This blog uses the Grails web framework

This code uses Apache Derby as a RDBMS so get that set up and spin up the database server with ./startNetworkServer

Clone the project and run gradle to bring in dependencies. Next run grails run-app to launch the blog.

Set a SECRET_KEY environmental variable for the blogs crypto hashing functions ex. export SECRET_KEY=blogsarethebest
